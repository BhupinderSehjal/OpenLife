# 🌱 OpenLife

**OpenLife** is an open-source, community-driven productivity and reflection platform designed to help individuals **understand, analyze, and improve how they spend their time every day**.

Instead of focusing only on task completion, OpenLife emphasizes **time awareness, workflow clarity, habit reflection, and continuous self-improvement** — all built in the open, by the community.

## 🧠 Why OpenLife?

Most productivity tools answer:

> *“What tasks did you complete?”*

OpenLife asks deeper questions:

* ⏳ Where did your time actually go today?
* 🔍 What patterns repeat in your daily workflow?
* 🚫 Where are productivity leaks happening?
* 🔁 What small habits can be improved consistently?

OpenLife helps users **reflect first**, then improve — one day at a time.
